Dr. Ping Luo is an Assistant Professor at Algoma University, Brampton, Canada. His research focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning to next-generation sequencing data, particularly within the context of liquid biopsy and immunotherapy. He is actively developing computational models for cancer early detection using circulating cell-free DNA, leveraging fragmentomic and methylation data. In parallel, he is exploring deep learning frameworks to predict tumor-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs), which play a critical role in TCR-T therapy development.

Dr. Luo earned his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada (2019). Before joining Algoma University, he worked as a Bioinformatics Specialist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, where he contributed to TCR-focused immunology studies. This experience deepened his expertise in immuno-oncology and continues to inform his research in precision medicine and computational immunology.
